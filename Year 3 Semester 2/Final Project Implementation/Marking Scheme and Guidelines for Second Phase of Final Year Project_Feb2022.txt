- 5.1 Summary of the Design, Implementation and Testing of the Individual Components - 8 marks

     5.1.1 Component-1(form)
       - state what is the purpose of this component is in the system. e.g. The purpose of the form in this system
         was to gather information about the particular vehicle
       - summarize its design approach and indicate where the details of its design can be located in the report
         e.g. it utilized a data entry approach with error checking, the details of which are given in pages 45-57 in ch 4.
       - summarize its implementation procedure and indicate where the details can be located in the report
	 e.g. This design approach was implemented using html for its layout and java script for error checking, further details
         can be found on pages 58-60 in ch4.      
       - summarize the testing procedure utilized and the results obtained, and where it can be found in the report
         e.g. to test the form component, various forms of data was inputed into the respective fields, and it showed that only
         the specified types of data in the design were saved, thus proving that it was working as designed (pictures of results 
         can be shown for reference). Full details of these tests and their corresponding results are given in pages 57-61 in ch 4.

         boundaries of the tests perfomred) 
       - state any problems encountered. e.g. some issues were encountered with the initial firefox platform, but this was solved
         by using the xamp platform.

     5.1.2 Component-2(database)
      - Repeat section 5.1.1 (Component-1) for each major component of the system

- 5.2 Summary of the Design, Implementation and Testing of the Entire System - 5 marks
	- state how the functionality of the system was achieved from testing multiple individual components and indicate where these 
	  details can be found in the report e.g. the functionality for the overall ICT system for selling cars was achieved  
          by linking the individual components in a sequential manner of form-database-website-map, the full details are shown 
          in pages 67-70 in ch3.
	- summarize the testing procedure utilized and the results obtained, and where it can be found in the report
          e.g. two types of tests were utilized for testing the system, one involving different input data, and the other different users.
          For the tests involving different input data, multiple components were tested together such as the: i) form and the database, 
          ii) the database & website, and iii) the form, the database the website and the map. One of the test that was done with all
          of the components involved inputing data into the forms, which went to the database and then showed up on the map on the website.
          map & website) with various input data and users (pictures of results can be shown for reference). Full details of these tests can 
          be found on page 58-67 in ch4. The other type of tests involved giving multiple users the same tasks to perform and timing them. 
          The results of these tests showed that the all the users performed the specified tasks within a short time frame (pictures of 
          results can be shown for reference)
        - State what the resuts of these test mean. The results obtained from the input data tests mean that entire system is working as 
          designed (within the boundaries of the tests perfomred). Whereas the user tests, the short time frame obtained indicates that 
          the system is fairly easy to navigate and use 
        - state any problems encountered. e.g. some issues were encountered with the local server, but this was solved.
        - state anything that can be done in the future to improve this component e.g. perform testing on a live server

        - state how different functionality aspects of the system was tested by various users and indicate where these results can be
          found in the report.
        - summarize the testing procedure utilized and the results obtained, and where it can be found in the report
        - State what the resuts of these test mean. 
        - state any problems encountered. e.g. some issues were encountered with the local server, but this was solved.
        - state anything that can be done in the future to improve this component e.g. perform testing on a live server
  

- 5.3 Final Thoughts - 1 mark
        - state what was discussed in this chapter
